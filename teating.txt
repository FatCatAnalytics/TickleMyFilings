# EdgarScraper

EdgarScraper is a Python tool designed to automate the fetching and analysis of SEC filings from the EDGAR database. It simplifies the process of retrieving financial data, parsing complex XML documents, and filtering for specific information like hedge accounting or derivative instruments.

## Features

- Automated fetching of SEC filings based on CIK and form type.
- Parsing of XML filings into structured Python data types.
- Filtering of filing content based on user-defined keywords.
- Modular design for easy customization and extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- `pip` for installing dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EdgarScraper.git
cd EdgarScraper
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Before using EdgarScraper, update the `HEADER` information in `data_fetching.py` to include your email or website. This is necessary to comply with the SEC's request to identify who is making the request.

```python
class EdgarScraper:
    HEADER = {'User-Agent': 'Your Name <youremail@example.com>'}
```

Replace `'Your Name <youremail@example.com>'` with your actual name and email address or website. This is crucial for responsible use of the SEC's EDGAR system.

## Usage

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the EdgarScraper tool. Here's how to run it:

```bash
python main.py
```

For custom usage, you can import and use the EdgarScraper class in your Python scripts:

```python
from src.data_fetching import EdgarScraper

# Initialize scraper
scraper = EdgarScraper()

# Fetch filings
cik = '0000051143'  # Example CIK
submission_df = scraper.get_submission_df(cik, '10-K')
print(submission_df)
```
